sylpheed-unity is a fast hack to integrate sylpheed mail client in the unity
environment.

In sylpheed.desktop we add to items to the sylpheed menu - compose message
and receive all messages.

sylpheed is a script that launches sylpheed binary and starts to poll for
unread messages. If there are some it shows corresponding badge and sets
icon status to urgent.

Install instructions:
cp sylpheed.desktop /usr/share/applications
mv /usr/bin/sylpheed /usr/bin/sylpheed.bin
cp sylpheed /usr/bin/sylpheed
